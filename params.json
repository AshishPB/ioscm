{"body":"#Introduction#\r\nI/O Stream Congestion Meter is a benchmark to measure the effect of multiple concurrent I/O streams on one storage system. Each I/O stream in the benchmark is a squence of interleaving I/O operations and fake computation (Idle). It is part of an effort to understand the performance degradation (throughput, skew, fairness, ...) caused by I/O congestion for file systems like HDFS, PVFS, and ext4. Its features include:\r\n\r\n* Computation-I/O pattern per I/O stream group\r\n* Fast synchronization for small I/O streams\r\n* Supports hundreds of concurrent read/write I/O streams\r\n\r\n#An Example#\r\n<figure>\r\n  <img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-9zsrK9hxXvE/T_XGqTgektI/AAAAAAAAAA4/hSbJwuRyL-c/s1024/ioscm_intro.png\" title=\"A Case of I/O Congestion\" height=\"331\" width=\"480\" />\r\n  \r\n  <br><figcaption><b>Figure 1</b> A Case of I/O Congestion</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n#Build#\r\n``ant -f build.xml jar``\r\n\r\n#HowTo#\r\n* xml file in ``conf/`` defines the type and parameters for each I/O stream (group) in the testing\r\n* ``tool/ioscm-conf.py`` is a tool to specify parameters in configuration files\r\n* scripts in ``tests/`` give detailed usage cases\r\n\r\n#People#\r\n* Developer: [Siyuan Ma](http://siyuan.biz)","tagline":"I/O Stream Congestion Meter","note":"Don't delete this file!
